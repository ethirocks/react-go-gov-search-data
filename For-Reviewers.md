# Notes For Reviewers

## Core Features:
1. **HTTP Server**:
   - Listening on port 8080 for HTTP traffic.

2. **Endpoints**:
   - **GET /api/data**: Retrieves the data from government website

---

## Improvements Beyond Requirements:
1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Core components separated into the following packages:
     - `v1`: API version-specific logic for receipts.
     - `common`: Shared utilities and response helpers.
     - `logger`: Logging functionality for requests and errors.

2. **Logging**:
   - Middleware logs HTTP requests with method, path, and processing time.
   - Logs errors and exceptions for debugging and monitoring.

---

## Testing:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Thorough tests for core API handlers:
     - `GetGovernmentData`: Tests for the api

---

## Extra Enhancements:
1. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Comprehensive logging for successful operations and errors.

2. **README Documentation**:
   - Includes clear instructions

3. **Future Enhancements Suggested**:
   - Persistent database for data storage.
   - Token-based authentication for enhanced security.
   - Integration with external logging services for distributed monitoring.
